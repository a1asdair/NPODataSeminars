## About the seminar series
The Nonprofit Data Seminar series is a monthly 'virtual' seminar series presenting research using data related to the nonprofit sector from around the world.

All seminars are held at 8am (West Coast US) / 11am (East Coast US) / 4pm (UK) / 5pm (CET) / 8:30pm (IST) and last for one hour.

The virtual seminars can be viewed live through YouTube. Questions for the presenters can be submitted as YouTube comments. No log-in is required to view the seminar but you will need a Google Account to leave comments. A recording of the seminar will be available on YouTube after the event.

The Nonprofit Data Virtual Seminar Series is coordinated by Professor Alasdair Rutherford at the University of Stirling.
